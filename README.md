### ‚úÖ **Validation**
   - ‚úèÔ∏è Name Field**: Ensures the name entered by the user is at least 5 characters long. If the name is too short, an error message is displayed.
   - üîë Password Field**: The password is validated using three checks:
     - Must contain at least one lowercase letter.
     - Must contain at least one uppercase letter.
     - Must contain at least one number and be at least 6 characters long.
   - If any validation fails, an error message is displayed next to the corresponding field, guiding the user on how to correct the input.
    
     ```bash
      const hasLowerCase = /(?=.*[a-z])/;
        const hasUpperCase = /(?=.*[A-Z])/;
        const hasDigitAndLength = /(?=.*\d).{6,}/;

###üåê **Google Authentication**
   - Users can sign up using their Google account through Firebase Authentication.
   - Upon successful Google sign-in, the user is redirected to the homepage, and a success toast notification is shown.


     ```bash
       const AuthProvider = ({children}) => {
       const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
       const [loading,setLoading]=useState(true);
       
       const createNewUser=(email,password)=>{
           setLoading(true);
           return createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth,email,password)
       }
       const userLogin=(email,password)=>{
           setLoading(true);
           return signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth,email,password)
       }
       const logOut=()=>{
           setLoading(true);
           return signOut(auth)
       }
       const updateUserProfile=(updateData)=>{
           return updateProfile(auth.currentUser,updateData)
       }
      
### üñºÔ∏è **Profile Update**
   - After successful registration, the user's profile is updated with the provided `displayName` (from the form) and `photoURL` (from the photo URL input field).

###üëÅÔ∏è **Password Visibility Toggle**
   - The user can toggle the visibility of their password by clicking an eye icon. This improves the user experience when entering the password.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Handling**
   - The component includes robust error handling for both the user creation process and password validation. If any field doesn't meet the validation criteria, the user is informed with a clear error message next to the corresponding field.
